Python features in the type system
==================================

This section describes how certain specific features of the Python
language interact with the type system.

Tuples
------

The type of a tuple can be expressed by listing the element
types: ``tuple[int, int, str]`` is a tuple containing an int,
another int, and a str.  The empty tuple can be typed as
``tuple[()]``.  Arbitrary-length homogeneous tuples can be
expressed using one type and ellipsis, for example ``tuple[int, ...]``.

Annotating generator functions and coroutines
---------------------------------------------

The return type of generator functions can be annotated by
the generic type ``Generator[yield_type, send_type,
return_type]`` provided by ``typing.py`` module::

  def echo_round() -> Generator[int, float, str]:
      res = yield
      while res:
          res = yield round(res)
      return 'OK'

Coroutines introduced in :pep:`492` are annotated with the same syntax as
ordinary functions. However, the return type annotation corresponds to the
type of ``await`` expression, not to the coroutine type::

  async def spam(ignored: int) -> str:
      return 'spam'

  async def foo() -> None:
      bar = await spam(42)  # type is str

The generic ABC ``collections.abc.Coroutine`` can be used
to specify awaitables that also support
``send()`` and ``throw()`` methods. The variance and order of type variables
correspond to those of ``Generator``, namely ``Coroutine[T_co, T_contra, V_co]``,
for example::

  from collections.abc import Coroutine
  c: Coroutine[list[str], str, int]
  ...
  x = c.send('hi')  # type is list[str]
  async def bar() -> None:
      x = await c  # type is int

The generic ABCs ``Awaitable``,
``AsyncIterable``, and ``AsyncIterator`` can be used for situations where more precise
types cannot be specified::

  def op() -> collections.abc.Awaitable[str]:
      if cond:
          return spam(42)
      else:
          return asyncio.Future(...)
