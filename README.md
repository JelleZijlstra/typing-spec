# Typing Specification

This is a draft specification for the Python type system. It accompanies
a [proposal](https://discuss.python.org/t/proposed-new-typing-governance-process/34244)
to create a Typing Council that has the authority to create and maintain a spec.

I am creating the spec by collating the [typing PEPs](https://peps.python.org/topic/typing/),
essentially copy-pasting their "Specification" sections and editing them only to the
extent necessary to keep the document coherent.

The aim for now is to keep the normative specification the same as the PEPs, so no edits
should be made that affect the content of the specification. Once the Typing Council exists,
it can start making more substantive changes.

Editorial contributions are welcome. Those can include:

* Incorporating more PEPs. I am going through the list chronologically; check the
  `git log` for the latest PEPs covered.
* Making sure the text reads as a specification, not as a proposal, e.g. by removing
  references to how something "will" work, or to "this PEP".
* Reorganizing the text to make the entire document more coherent.
* Removing or rewriting clearly obsolete material.

No substantive changes should be made yet, not even if they seem uncontroversial.
I expect that once the Typing Council exists, one of its first actions will be to
adopt this document as the official specification. Subsequently, the Council will
consider changes to improve the specification.

However, feel free to open issues on this repo for cases where a spec change seems
warranted. Discussion should be kept to a minimum, though; this is not the place to
discuss controversial issues.
